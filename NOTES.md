# Janteiros 2.0 notes

## Decisions
- Kit `arena_kit.total_cost` is the only C. `sim2` subclasses the kit's `Sim` so the API is identical.
- Forbidden paths refused in `Arena._call` and in an httpx request hook (both levels tested).
- `jt play/run` refuse a non-local ARENA_URL unless `--real` (humans only).
- Policy derives everything from thread messages, so a resume after a crash is exact.

## M1 plan (skeleton + safety)
repo, uv, hook, guard+test, wrapper, event log, runner, validator, trivial policy on S01-S03.
